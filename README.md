# Predicting-unemployment-rate

 The project is based on Predicting Unemployment Rate Data using Machine Learning .Find the relevant data from the sources like: Kaggle, UCI etc.
	Download the data set in .xlsx format from ⦁	www.kaggle.com

#Steps followed to complete this project:

	Download the data set in .xlsx format from ⦁	www.kaggle.com
	Import the data from the data set
	Calculate the average unemployment rate for every year( by doing summation of the rate of every 12 months and find its mean)
	Plot the graph of unemployment rate
	Now divide the data sets into two parts:-
	Training data set
	Testing data set
	The task of training data set is to train our model as the data set taken consists of 70 years data and we are using every 30 years data   to predict the unemployment rate in the 31st year
	And the task of the testing data set is to predict the first value in the testing data set using the last 30 values in the training data set
	Implement these Machine Learning algorithms and plot their respective graphs with original and predicted labels -
	Linear Regression
	KNN
	Decision Tree
	Random Forest
	SVM
  At last plot the graphs of all the models and the original unemployment rate.
  Compare all the models with the original graph on the basis of their accuracy and select the best working model for predictions.
